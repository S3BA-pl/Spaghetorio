Buildings: Graphics (https://www.figma.com/proto/8ecwGOzYos13D0JTwV5kO9/Factorio-Buildings?node-id=2585-1158&node-type=frame&t=Tt0H6pFe0h0uH68x-0&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1ui%3D1&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1)
  - cyclotron (Use convector building from hurricane406)
  - particle accelerator (Use fusion reactor building from hurricane406)
  - Acroshpere converter or blunagium extractor (Use oxidizer building from hurricane406)
  - core miner (Use core extractor building from hurricane406) (for version 0.2.0)
    - Core mining should have different ressources to mine from. Every resource returns a combination of ores / metals.
  - Lumber mill (Use Lumber mill from hurricane406)
  - Low gravity assembling machine (Use Low gravity assembling machine from hurricane406)
  - Something else :D (Use Arc furnace from hurricane406) - I think the building uses heatpipes

Items:
  - Seal
  - Bearing
  - Seeds (for trees)
  - Antimatter trains
  - Antimatter cube
  - Quantized matter
  - Polarized matter
  - Coolant with different temperatures (coolant does not have a real purpose right now, see Idea coolant)
  - Vacuum chamber
  - Alloys:

  - For semiconductors:
    - Tantalum nitride
    - Silicon nitride
    - Wafer
  - Nuclear products:
    - Isotopes of some elements. (Create recipes which take in one isotope and have 50% chance during their halflife to convert to another element)
  - Alloy science pack t2 and t3
  - More T4 tech cards

Recipes:
  + Disable productivity for acro-conversion recipes
  - Add multiple recipes for blank tech cards
  - Add recipes for fluids via acromatter
  - Dirty water can be evaporated
  - Add more complex recipe change for semiconductors
  - Add alternative recipes for existing things that use lead (like pipes, valves...)
  - Add smelt crafting recipes for advanced assembling machine (see "kr-automation")
  + Remove some barrel recipes like helium-3, grobgnum-liquids and matter recipes (Or add other containers that are not normal barrels)
  - Add recycling recipes for items that clog up production chain (break unused things down to trash and use trash for low grade recipes)
  - Add special barrel for alien liquids
  - Add special barrel for cold liquids like liquid nitrogen
  - Add special barrel for radioactive liquids
  - Not sure why enriched zirconium ore is missing

Resources:
  - Obsidian (for core miner - volcanic rock that contains silica, aluminum and potassium) (for version 0.2.0)

Technologies:
  - Add Infinite technologies:
    -

Ideas:
  - Change fluid inputs and outputs for kr-matter-plant and kr-matter-assembler
  - Configure stack sizes in settings
  - Burn useless things for energy
  - Add multiple liquit inputs / outputs for assembling machines. Coolant might be here interesting to use.
  - Insertirters can be affected by modules
  - Krastorio has 3 icons for blank tech cards, edit its colors and use it for different things.
  - Create multiple resurce patches for grobgnum (for version 0.2.0)
  - Only higher tier miners can mine high tier resources (for version 0.2.0)
  - Add scripting to acrospheres (for version 0.3.0 or higher)

Other:
  + Fix complex recipes not showing up in some machines
  - Support text plates mod
  - Fix energy values of fluids (see heat_capacity)
  + Fix barrel tints
  + Fix smoke tints for chemical plant
  + Krastorio: add radioactivity
  - Asteroid mining
  - Add glow to tech cards
  - Update icons with isometric perspective:
    - Alloys
    - Plates
    - Ingots
    - Mirror
    - Infra red filter
  - Add glow to alien items
  - Fix stack sizes (for version 0.2.0)
  - Fix resource spawning (for version 0.2.0)

Low prio:
  - Reorder in lua code recipes, items for simpler searching
  - Add new files for changing subgroup (just like order-fixes.lua)
  - Create function to generate acroproduct-conversion recipes
  - Create file for acroproduct-conversion recipes
  - For items and fluids add to icon chemical formula and add picture without chemical formula (such that when item is on conveyor belt text does not show up). Also try to add this feature for barrels.
