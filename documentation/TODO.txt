    - Core mining should have different ressources to mine from. Every resource returns a combination of ores / metals.
  - Lumber mill (Use Lumber mill from hurricane406)
  - Low gravity assembling machine (Use Low gravity assembling machine from hurricane406)
  - Electrolysis plant for factorio space age (Use Arc furnace from hurricane406) - I think the building uses heatpipes

      - A good example is the nickel-cobalt alloy, MP35N, which consists of nickel and cobalt and is ideally suited to marine and subsea applications due to its resistance to hydrogen sulphide, salt water and mineral acids, which can have a highly corrosive effect on most metals. Monel is a nickel-based alloy that incorporates copper and iron. It is corrosion resistant and acid resistant, so is suitable for marine applications as well as applications involving acids and other highly corrosive substances.
