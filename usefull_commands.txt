Add new resource patch
This creates a new 11Ã—11 patch of resources, centered on the player character, where the ground is not water. The patch it creates is perfectly square but it randomizes the amount similar to natural generation, with fewer ore at the edges and more ore in the center. The default numbers result in a patch with 2500-3000 ore.

If you want a larger patch, change "local size = 5" to a larger number. A larger patch will have exponentially more ore. Entering a number above 30 is not recommended.

If you want a richer patch, change "local density = 10" to a larger number. Entering a very large number shouldn't hurt anything but you probably don't need to go above 100.

To choose which resource is spawned, change "stone" near the bottom to "iron-ore", "copper-ore", "coal", or "uranium-ore".

/c local surface=game.player.surface
local ore=nil
local size=19
local density=50
for y=-size, size do
	for x=-size, size do
		a=(size+1-math.abs(x))*10
		b=(size+1-math.abs(y))*10
		if a<b then
			ore=math.random(a*density-a*(density-8), a*density+a*(density-8))
		end
		if b<a then
			ore=math.random(b*density-b*(density-8), b*density+b*(density-8))
		end
		if surface.get_tile(game.player.position.x+x, game.player.position.y+y).collides_with("ground-tile") then
			surface.create_entity({name="sp-aluminum-ore", amount=ore, position={game.player.position.x+x, game.player.position.y+y}})
		end
	end
